## The Engagement Selection

When you run an activity, you'll see a dialog with your options:
- **Start New** — Begin a fresh engagement
- **Resume** — Continue a previous engagement (if available)

Each engagement tracks your progress and responses separately, allowing you to run the same activity multiple times.

## During an Activity

### Activity Interface

- **Step header** shows current section and progress
- **Components** display content and collect your inputs
- **Navigation** buttons move between steps

### Component Types

Activities include various components:
- **Text** — Instructions and information
- **Input fields** — Enter your responses
- **Sliders and ratings** — Quick assessments
- **AI prompts** — Get personalized feedback

### Saving Take-Aways

While running, you can save important content to your Workspace:

1. Click the **⋮ menu** on any text field
2. Choose:
   - **Add as action item** — save as a task
   - **Copy to insights** — save as a learning

The **Take-Aways panel** on the left shows your saved items during the activity.

## Completing an Activity

When you finish:

1. **Engagement Completed** dialog appears
2. Review your action items and insights
3. Add an **Epilogue** reflection (optional)
4. Click **Continue** to return to dashboard

Your take-aways are now available in your **Workspace**.
