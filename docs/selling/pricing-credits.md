# Pricing & Credits

Setting the right price is crucial for success. This guide covers pricing strategies, the credit system, and maximizing revenue.

## Pricing Fundamentals

### Value-Based Pricing

Price based on value delivered, not just time or effort:

**Consider:**
- What problem does it solve?

- What result can users expect?

### Market Research

Study comparable offerings:
- Similar ClaryNext activities
- Online courses on same topic
- Coaching services in your niche
- Book/content pricing

Psychological factors:
- $19 feels cheaper than $20
- Anchoring with higher "value" shown
- Bundles feel like better deals
- Free trials reduce risk
